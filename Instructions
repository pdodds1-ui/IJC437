First download the folders of 'popularity' and 'songfeatures' from https://marianaossilva.github.io/DSW2019/ - these were too large to upload to GitHub directly into my repository.
Extract the folders. Deposit the necessary CSV files (lyrics.csv and acoustic_features.csv from the songfeatures folder as well as song_chart.csv from the popularity folder) into the same folder
Copy the R code and paste into an R script file. Edit the code to set the working directory to the relevant folder containing the CSV files.
Make sure to install and load all the libraries listed before running any code.
Run the code.

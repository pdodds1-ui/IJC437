An Investigation into Hit Song Prediction: Project for University of Sheffield Coursework on MSc Data Science.
This project investigates the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit or not using audio features, lyrics analysis and further explores the change of top charting music over time. This uses the MusicOSet from Zenodo: https://marianaossilva.github.io/DSW2019/
Findings in this project were significant changes in audio features present in the top 10 over the years 1964 to 2018.
Attempts at designing a logistic regression model to aid in predicting hit songs vs non-hit songs reached a maximum accuracy of 62.9%. Repeatability of lyrics was found here to have no impact on the prediction of success in the charts.
